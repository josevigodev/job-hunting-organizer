# 🗃️ Job Hunt Organizer

A modern **job tracking application** that helps you organize your job search process using a clean and interactive **Kanban board**. You can add jobs, group them by status (Offer, Applied, Interview, Rejected), and move them between columns with **drag & drop**. All data is saved locally using `localStorage`, so nothing is lost between sessions.
